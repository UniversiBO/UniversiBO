UniversiBO
==========
## What is UniversiBO?
UniversiBO was a Web Community joined by Students, Professors and Staff in Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna, Italy since 2002.
* Version 1 was a PHP-PostgreSQL "old style" application
* Since version 2 we migrated to eocene framework  (http://sourceforge.net/projects/eocene-php/)
* Version 3 is a porting to Symfony 2.x framework (http://symfony.com/)

On Tuesday, 25 Feb 2020 the only production server crashed abruptly and on June 2020 the student association ceased its activities.

## Running UniversiBO
You can get a working copy of UniversiBO in 6 easy steps:

1. Install virtualbox https://www.virtualbox.org/
2. Install Vagrant http://vagrantup.com/
3. Run ```vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest```
4. Fork this repository and clone it
5. Run ```cd vagrant && vagrant up``` and wait around ten minutes while Vagrant
does all the magic
6. Open your browser at http://localhost:8888/app_dev.php

Then you can log in, available users:

* `admin`
* `student`
* `professor`
* `tutor`
* `staff`

password is always `padrino`

### Running automated tests
Do `vagrant ssh` to get inside the virtual machine and `cd /vagrant` to
get to the proper directory.

* PHPUnit (including Selenium) tests `bin/phpunit -c app`
* Behat:
    * `bin/behat @UniversiboDashboardBundle`
    * `bin/behat @UniversiboWebsiteBundle`

Xvfb, Firefox and Selenium Server are already installed.

To **enable** Selenium testing run `/etc/init.d/selenium start`

To **disable** Selenium testing run `/etc/init.d/selenium stop`

## Past contributors
We did our best to preserve the whole history from our [Subversion Repository](https://sourceforge.net/p/universibo/svn/) but something has been lost.
A special thank to [iliasbartolini](https://github.com/iliasbartolini) who founded and led the project in its first years of development (560 commits) together with
Andrea and Matteo who worked hard on management side and to the other (around) 200 people involved in this project over the years.
